# Project Overview
Our project ([GitHub](https://github.com/aldenyue/ECE-148-F22-Team-9-Final-Project)) is a emotional support robot that can detect the emotions from people's faces. The robot runs on a Jetson Nano and uses an OAK-D Lite Camera for recognition and distance measurements. We use [DepthAI's emotional recognition example](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/gen2-face-recognition) for our detection. The robot searches for the face of a sad person, and once confirmed, drives up to the person in question to cheer them up! The therapy routine consists of both music and a dance.
